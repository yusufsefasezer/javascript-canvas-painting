Another crucial feature of this application is the option to change the line size. Users have the freedom to adjust the thickness of their brush strokes, allowing for diverse styles and techniques. From thin, delicate lines to bold, sweeping strokes, the JavaScript Canvas Painting app empowers artists to create unique and captivating artwork.

For those who want to start fresh or make changes to their artwork, the app provides a convenient "Clear" button.
